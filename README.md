Facial Recognition & Emotion Detection for Student Attendance API

Overview

This project is an ASP.NET Core Web API for an automated student attendance system using Facial Recognition and Emotion Detection powered by AI. The system captures student images, identifies faces, detects emotions, and records attendance in a database.

Features

Facial Recognition: Detects and identifies students using AI-based facial recognition.

Emotion Detection: Analyzes students' emotions during attendance.

Automated Attendance Recording: Saves attendance status in a database.

RESTful API: Provides endpoints for managing students, attendance records, and authentication.

Secure Authentication: Uses JWT for secure API access.

Database Integration: Stores student data and attendance logs using SQL Server.
